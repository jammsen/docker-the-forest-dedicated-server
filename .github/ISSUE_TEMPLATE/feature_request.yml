        ## Important information
        Thank you for taking the time to fill out this feature request! Please understand you are asking for support for the Docker-Image and Docker-Container. I'm NOT the creator of the Dedicated-Game-Server itself, i'm not involved in programming that. If you need help for that, you might want to ask here for topics related to that: https://steamcommunity.com/app/242760/discussions/0/485623406958849620/
